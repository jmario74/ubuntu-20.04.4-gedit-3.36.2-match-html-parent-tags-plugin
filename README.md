# ubuntu-20.04.4-gedit-3.36.2-match-html-parent-tags-plugin
Custom plugin for Gedit version 3.36.2 on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS Focal  
INSTALLATION:  
add to "~/.local/share/gedit/plugins" folder/folders or if it doesn't exist; create the folder/folders.  
NOTE:  
The coding of this plugin is to the best of my knowlege of the GEdit API. It will highlight the start & end tags of the parent tag from where the cursor is currently placed; remove that highlight or select anything in between.
